Minimal corrector lattice documentation:
Please note: these lattices only handle horizontal beam correction right now:
the correctors themselves are set up for horizontal, vertical, and optics corrections,
but I haven't added the necessary diagnostics yet.

Furthermore, the file 'tao.init' in the namelist &tao_params must contain the lines:

  global%opt_with_ref = F
  global%opt_with_base = T

otherwise corrector optimization won't work.


To run, navigate to the 'East Arc' or 'West Arc' folder from the command line, enter 'tao' and bazinga

the best optimizer to use for corrections is svd: to add errors to the lattice, at the tao prompt enter one of:

change particle_start <attribute> <amount to change nominal value by>
change ele <element reference #> <attribute> <amount to change nominal value by>
change var <variable name> <amount to change nominal value by>

or

set particle_start <attribute> <new value of attribute>
set ele <element reference #> <attribute> <new value of attribute>
set var <variable name> <new value of variable>


and repeat for as many errors as you like. 
Then, at the tao prompt enter 'run svd' 
and voila! you've run the basic correction scheme.

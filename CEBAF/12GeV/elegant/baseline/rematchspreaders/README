These command files are designed to rematch the spreaders after one has loaded a new gradient distribution 
 and quad distribution in the linacs. That sdds file is generated by lem2sdds.

Each spreader is then rematched to account for it.

The sequence is :

elegant iha5lemmedNL.ele
elegant ARC1MATCH.ele
elegant iha5lemmedstep0NL.ele
elegant ARC2MATCH.ele
elegant iha5lemmedstep1NL.ele
etc..

the command files read the output of the previous operation so it has to be executed in this order.

 a prerequisite to do all of that is to have already generated the standard decks and calculated REINJq.sdds for that
 energy profile. Also, all the design decks need to have been run in the parent directory in order for these command files to 
retrieve the twiss parameters at design locations.

A set of scripts has been written to import the decks into the CED.

After going through the steps described in the README file to generate
 all the possible beamlines,one has to do the following:

0) set the linac energy running scalelinacs <value>

edit ihd.ele to get the proper scale factors in it.
and set the lemi profile.

the lemi profile is obtained via running lemi at command line for the desired target kinetic energy.
e.g

lemi -e 121 -bc 150 -la 2 -o setupfor121

would setup for 121 kinetic with 150 microamps max current and 2 mev allowance for locks.
 the output file 'setupfor121' will contain the gsets for the 0L03 and 0L04 zone.



run makecmdfiles which will propagate that to all the command files.

using ihd.ele, comment out the optimize and stop and the params in the first part of the file. run the ihd.ele, it will match the injector chicane and produce rematch.params.

go back comment out the params and the optimization again. subsequent runs will skip that match and use the params file to setup the main machine.


1) run elegant on the beamlines:

 elegant ihd.ele
 elegant iha1.ele
 ..
 ..
 elegant iha5.ele

same thing for hallc and b decks once we get them.

First, import the main ring (1/4 cryo to Hall D):
 req csuedvl
./importCED ihd 

will generate files that are designed to be imported into the CED. 

all the import scripts can be invoked with a CED workspace. The default is Optics.
doing ./runloadQUADS MyCED  would populate the MyCED workspace..

We then run:

./runloadQUADS
./runloadDipoles
./runloadCAVS
./runloadMONI
./runloadKICK

Each of these will take several minutes to complete.

import the extracted lines along with the Hall A line:

./pass1import
./pass2import
./pass3import
./pass4import
./pass5import

then import HALLB and HALLC. these scripts start importing past the lambertson.
they adjust the Y flr coordinate appropriately. (100-0.022 for hall c, 100 for hall B)

pass1HALLBimport
pass2HALLBimport
...
pass5HALLBimport
pass1HALLCimport
...
...
pass5HALLCimport

pass1bsydump
pass2bsydump
pass3bsydump
pass4bsydump
pass5bsydump

All of this will only work if you have the privilege to write the
Optics workspace of the CED.

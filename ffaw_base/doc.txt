This file contains basic documentations for the contents of ffaW_base

The folder contains six passes at different energies, through the periodic Bmad lattice of the east ffa arc.

Dejan_params_east.bmad contains all of the machine constants and parameters used by the lattice elements.

W_ele_def.bmad contains the definitions of elements in the lattice; please note that I've used 'patch geometry' to build these elements, 
and so the correspondence between physical magnets and simulated model is not exactly one-to-one.

W_Arc_Lattice.bmad contains the lattice line of those elements, in a few different cell number configurations.

p#w.lat contain the beam/particle starting parameters for pass #

Tao.init, tao.startup, and tao_plot.init are initialization files for bmad which define how the simulation will treat the lattices.




To run the simulation, navigate to the folder containing all the above files in a bash terminal, (other shells don't work, must be bash) and enter the command 'tao' (without quotes) to run tao.

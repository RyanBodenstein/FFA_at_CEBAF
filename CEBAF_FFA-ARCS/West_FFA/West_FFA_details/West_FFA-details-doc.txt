This file contains basic documentations for the contents of West_FFA_details.


These files construct the machine simulation of the west FFA arc.

"".params.bmad defines machine constants and parameters, eg field strengths and drift lengths

"".ele.bmad contains the element definitions: for now this amounts to two permanent magnets, drifts between them, and the associated code jiggery.

"".lat.bmad contains the assemblage of elements into a lattice cell, and then different repetitions of the cell. Full length is the default number of cells.

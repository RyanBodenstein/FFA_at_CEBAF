!!! This version has ABCCBA magnets with a scaled gradient to make them more realistic

The structure of this folder is thus:

At the top level, there are files which contain all the initial conditions for the optics of this particular machine section. 
These files should be named like <name><pass#>.bmad
Additionally, there are tao initialization files: tao.init, tao_plot.init, tao.startup
Finally, there are two sub-folders: 'machine' and 'juice'

'machine' contains all the machine parameters for the section (in <date>_params_<section>.bmad) as well as the machine element layout (<section>.lat) and any other files I used to check things or reference, eg Stephen's muon1 code or mathematica notebooks.

'juice' is where I put the files bmad spits out when it solves the closed lattice; I keep them for posterity.

These files are those used to develop the BMAD spreader files. Errors are likely.

To run these, load them with the appropriate init file:

tao -lat Pass*_Test.bmad -init tao_p*.init

* is the pass number.

Recall that the NE spreader is in the East arc, and therefore only sees "odd" passes: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19.

! Lattice parameters %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

parameter[geometry] = open                      ! not a periodic lattice
parameter[particle] = electron                  ! This is for CEBAF, after all



! Starting parameters %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

! Reference energy
beginning[e_tot] = 11.55e9                      ! Reference energy is 11.55 GeV

! Twiss parameters 'cus we need 'em for now
beginning[beta_a] = 10.                         ! m  a-mode beta function
beginning[beta_b] = 10.                         ! m  b-mode beta function



! Lattice elements %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

! These names are (more or less) adopted from Stephen's file
! I'm making the combined function magnets RBEND magnets, which 
! allows us to set up to a sextupole moment and fringe fields.

! MAGNETS

! Focusing magnet
BF1: rbend, L = 2.42249, angle = -0.0350268,
    ! magnet type, length, bending angle in radians
    ! dipole strength K0 = -0.0175134002598247,
     K1 = -22.297 !, fringe = 
    ! quadrupole moment, fringe field

! Defocusing magnet
BD1: rbend, L = 0.59529,  angle = -0.0052798,
    ! magnet type, length, bending angle in radians
    ! dipole strength: K0 = -0.341709940275209,  
     K1 = 70.045 !, fringe = 
    ! quadrupole moment, fringe field


! DRIFT
O: drift, L = 0.11547


! MATCH
m: match, beta_a0 = 10, beta_b0 = 10,
   beta_a1 = 10, beta_b1 = 10



! SETUP %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

! BF-O-BD-O cell
frodo: line = (BF1, O, BD1, O)
! repeat it three times
rep: line = (frodo, m, frodo, m, frodo)

! Use the repeating lattice
use, rep

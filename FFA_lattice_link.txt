Hello and welcome to 'Figuring out what the hell the FFA optics look like anyway'

First and most importantly, all current Bmad lattices (per Alex C, at least) 
may be found on the LDRD github at: https://github.com/RyanBodenstein/FFA_at_CEBAF/tree/main/CEBAF/22GeV/Bmad/FFA%20ARCS

Before use of those lattices, please read the readme, which serves as basic documentation. 
Further questions about the lattices themselves may be directed to alexcoxe@jlab.org

Also at that page is a spreadsheet containing the entrance end optics and beam positions
for all six passes through each FFA arc in the nominal (no errors anywhere) case.

Thanks for your time, and here's hoping you don't get too angry or depressed!
